                <p>
                    The Ogden Yoga Festival started in 2011 to help raise money
                    for those who have been a victim of domestic violence by
                    donating 100% of the proceeds to the Ogden
                    <a href="http://www.ycchope.org" target="_blank">YCC</a>.
                    Teachers from all over the area donate their time and
                    talents to contribute to this festival and bring many
                    flavors of Yoga and healthy living for everyone to
                    experience.
                </p>

                <h2>Our Goal</h2>
                <p>
                    To build awareness about yoga in Ogden and the surrounding
                    community, and raise funds for the
                    <a href="http://www.ycchope.org" target="_blank"> Family Crisis Center</a>
                    in Ogden.
